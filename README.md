# jonBatmanCowl
The batman Cowl project from HackerLabs updated with all the code right up until the last commit

This project was built using Unity and C#, with a focus on Microsoft Hololens.  
We mainly interfaced with the device itself, attempting to utlize the voice and facial recognition for our own purposes.
I assisted with Speech recognition as well as general debugging problems that anyone was having. 
If interested, the first episode is here: https://youtu.be/h2-1ZUQxFsU
If interested in the rest, the series is called Hackerlabs: Batman Cowl
